# Number Sequences (Generator)
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/Nq3DWe8-stQ

#### Description:

This project is a simple and modern web application designed to generate various types of mathematical sequences. The web app allows users to easily create and visualize three fundamental mathematical sequences:

* **Arithmetic Progression (AP)**
* **Geometric Progression (GP)**
* **Fibonacci Sequence**

The application is built using fundamental web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. Additionally, it uses **MathJax** to render mathematical equations neatly, making the interface user-friendly and visually appealing. The app is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, ensuring that it's easy to access and use on any device with a web browser. This project was developed as part of my final submission for the **CS50** course, which is known for its rigorous and comprehensive approach to computer science.

With this web app, users can instantly generate sequences by simply providing the necessary inputs like the first term, common difference (for AP), common ratio (for GP), or the number of terms (for Fibonacci). This app makes learning about these sequences much more interactive and hands-on.

## ✨ Features

* **Clean and Modern UI**: The user interface is designed to be minimalistic yet functional. It provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making the app easy to navigate even for those who are new to mathematical sequences.

* **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts its layout for various screen sizes, whether it's a mobile device, tablet, or desktop. This ensures that users can access the app on the go without any functionality loss.

* **Instant Sequence Generation**: The main feature of this web app is the ability to instantly generate the three sequences – Arithmetic Progression (AP), Geometric Progression (GP), and Fibonacci Sequence. Users can enter values such as the first term, common difference, and the number of terms to get a sequence generated in real-time.

* **Active Navbar Highlighting**: The navigation bar highlights the active page, which makes it easy for users to know which section of the app they are currently viewing. This improves the overall navigation experience.

* **No Backend Required**: This app is designed to run entirely on the frontend, which means that it does not require a server or backend infrastructure to function. This makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.

* **MathJax Integration**: The app uses **MathJax**, a powerful JavaScript library, to render mathematical equations clearly. Whether it's an AP or a Fibonacci sequence, MathJax ensures that the formulas are displayed neatly and accurately.

* **Clear Instructions and Examples**: For those who are new to sequences, the app provides clear instructions on how to use the generator. Additionally, example sequences are included to guide users in understanding the functionality.

* **Downloadable Sequence Results**: Users can download the generated sequence in text format or copy it directly to the clipboard for further use.

* **Browser Compatibility**: The app is fully compatible with all modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. This ensures that users can access the app from almost any device without encountering any issues.

* **Open Source**: The source code for the web app is open source and available for everyone to contribute or modify. This encourages community collaboration and allows other developers to improve upon the project.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### **HTML5**:

HTML5 is the backbone of this web application, providing the basic structure and elements needed to create the user interface. It allows for clean and semantic markup, making the web app accessible and easy to maintain.

### **CSS3**:

CSS3 is used for styling the application. It helps make the web app visually appealing by applying modern design principles. The use of CSS Grid and Flexbox ensures a responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

### **JavaScript (ES6)**:

JavaScript is used to implement the core functionality of the app. With the power of ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring, the code is more concise and easier to read. JavaScript allows the app to dynamically generate the sequences based on user input, update the interface in real time, and handle all user interactions.

### **Bootstrap 5**:

Bootstrap 5 is a front-end framework that provides a set of pre-styled components and utilities. It helps speed up the development process and ensures that the web app is responsive, functional, and visually appealing. The app makes extensive use of Bootstrap's grid system, buttons, modals, and other UI components.

### **MathJax**:

MathJax is a powerful JavaScript library that renders mathematical equations beautifully. It is used in this app to display sequences and formulas in a readable, professional manner. Whether it's the general formula for an arithmetic progression or the Fibonacci recurrence relation, MathJax ensures that everything is rendered with precision and clarity.

### **GitHub Pages**:

GitHub Pages is used to host the application. This is a free and simple way to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It allows the app to be easily accessible from any device with a web browser, and since GitHub Pages automatically handles HTTPS, the app is secure to use.

### How to Use the App:

1. Choose the type of sequence you want to generate: AP, GP, or Fibonacci.
2. Enter the required input values (like the first term, common difference, common ratio, or number of terms).
3. Click on the "Generate Sequence" button.
4. The sequence will be displayed instantly on the page.
5. You can download the result or copy it to your clipboard for further use.

## Conclusion:

This web app is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to learn more about mathematical sequences, whether for academic purposes or just out of curiosity. With a clean and modern interface, real-time sequence generation, and a fully responsive design, it provides a simple yet powerful solution for generating arithmetic progressions, geometric progressions, and Fibonacci sequences. By using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this app is fast, lightweight, and easy to use. Feel free to explore, contribute, and customize the app to suit your needs.
